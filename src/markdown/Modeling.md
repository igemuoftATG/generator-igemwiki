## Modeling

#### Note

In order to be considered for the [Best Model
award](http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#SpecialPrizes), you must fill out
this page.

Mathematical models and computer simulations provide a great way to describe the
function and operation of BioBrick Parts and Devices. Synthetic Biology is an
engineering discipline, and part of engineering is simulation and modeling to
determine the behavior of your design before you build it. Designing and
simulating can be iterated many times in a computer before moving to the lab.
This award is for teams who build a model of their system and use it to inform
system design or simulate expected behavior in conjunction with experiments in
the wetlab.

Here are a few examples from previous teams:

* [ETH Zurich 2014](http://2014.igem.org/Team:ETH_Zurich/modeling/overview)
* [Waterloo 2014](http://2014.igem.org/Team:Waterloo/Math_Book)
