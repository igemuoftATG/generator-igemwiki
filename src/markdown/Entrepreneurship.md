## Entrepreneurship

In previous years, iGEM had an entrepreneurship track. Teams were encouraged to
build projects and focus around commercializing their work. For 2015, we're
removing the track and introducing an <b>award</b> for entrepreneurship.


#### Note

In order to be considered for the [Best Supporting Entrepreneurship
award](http://2015.igem.org/Judging/Awards#SpecialPrizes), you must fill out
this page.

The Best Supporting Entrepreneurship award recognizes exceptional effort to
build a business case and commercialize an iGEM project. This award is open to
all teams to show that entrepreneurship is something all teams can aspire to do
with their project. This award can go to an new project, or to a previous
project that a team aimed to commercialize. Have you filed a provisional patent
on your project/device/process? Have you raised money to build and ship
products? Have you pitched your idea to investors and received money? Complete
the entrepreneurship section on the 2015 Judging form and tell us what you did.
As always in iGEM, the aim is to impress the judges!
