## Attributions

Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this
page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by
others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on
the team roster.

#### Can we base our project on a previous one?

Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's
idea, **as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the
original project.**

#### Why is this page needed?

The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and
what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex
techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done
by others.

For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project.
Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to
conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve
during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or
PI who has the right licenses.
