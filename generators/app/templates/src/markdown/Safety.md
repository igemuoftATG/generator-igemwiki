Please visit [the main Safety page](http://2016.igem.org/Safety) to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.

On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can **go beyond the questions on the safety forms**, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)

##### Safe Project Design

Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:

*   Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis
*   Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants
*   Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment
*   Including an "induced lethality" or "kill-switch" device

##### Safe Lab Work

What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!

##### Safe Shipment

Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?
