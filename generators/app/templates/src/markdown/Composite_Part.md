A composite part is a functional unit of DNA consisting of two or more basic
parts assembled together.
[BBa_I13507](http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_I13507) is an example
of a composite part, consisting of an RBS, a protein coding region for a red
fluorescent protein, and a terminator.

New composite BioBrick devices can be made by combining existing BioBrick Parts
(like Inverters, Amplifiers, Smell Generators, Protein Balloon Generators,
Senders, Receivers, Actuators, and so on).
